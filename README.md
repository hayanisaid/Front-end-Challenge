This template is build with vue.js and bootstrap 4,I used [vue.js]() because it's a great Framwork for UI and User Experience,so I used vue.js to handle and make nice animation,and has small size too.
in product section I created an Array of object that contain product detail,the way that helped me to handle product displaying ,and make dynamic page with vue-router,So when use click product title ,it go you to detail component with nice transition and blur effect while diplaying product details.
